- 👋 Hi, I’m Lisa
- 👀 I’m interested in learning Cybersecurity Analyst and Data Science for starters as I feel they both overlap and complement each other.
- Both disciplines require concrete technological skills, a knowledge of computers and data information systems, as well as mathematical, analytical, and problem-solving skills to organize large amounts of data or pinpoint any vulnerabilities.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and SQL to start, then moving on to other tools and methodologies.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects but have neither defined nor narrowed down the specifics yet.
- 📫 How to reach me ... via my LinkIn profile or here on Githb.
- 😄 Pronouns: ... She
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I like SciFi shows/movie with a good message or happy resolution just not scary ones like Aliens or Preditors.  I also like to play console games like PlayStation or XBox.
- ✨ Prior Experience as a Computer Tech and Network Administrator.  I have a Bachelors of Science Degree in Information Technology Management.
- 👏 I learned web page coding (HTML, CSS, Flash, etc) and put up several websites.
