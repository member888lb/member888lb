- 👋 Hi, I’m Lisa
- 👀 I’m interested in learning Cybersecurity and Data Science for starters as I feel they both overlap and complement each other.  I'm honing my skills related to Data Analyst and Data Engineering presently. Both disciplines require concrete technological skills, a knowledge of computers and data information systems, as well as mathematical, analytical, and problem-solving skills to organize large amounts of data or pinpoint any vulnerabilities.
- 🌱 I’m currently strengthening my skills in Python and SQL programming languages, then moving on to learning Bash, R, Java and C++ next.
- I am familiar with the following databases: MySQL,  NoSQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, IBM Db2 with PostgreSQL and neo4j to follow next in my learning.
- I am familiar with Operating Systems: Microsoft Windows, Linux (Kali) and Apple.  Maybe I'll learn Unix, we'll see.
- On my list of Containerization Tools to learn are Docker and Kubernetes.
- Im currently playing around with Data Transformation Tools: OpenRefine, ParseHub and Weka. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects but have neither defined nor narrowed down the specifics yet.
- 📫 How to reach me ... via my LinkIn profile or here on Githb.
- 😄 Pronouns: ... She
- ⚡ Fun fact: ... I like SciFi shows/movie with a good message or happy resolution just not scary ones like Aliens or Preditors.  I also like to play console games like PlayStation or XBox.
- ✨ Prior Experience as a Computer Tech and Network Administrator.  I have a Bachelors of Science Degree in Information Technology Management.
- 👏 I learned web page coding (HTML, CSS, Flash, etc) and put up several websites.
